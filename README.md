1. 	Well, first we have all that code inside a "html" tag with some options like class and "op". Meaning that all the next part is written  in html but only with the class specified.
	Next we have the "head" tag which we can see all the data that is not shown or, in some form, "meta" to the visual page. There is the style tag, some links for the css, icons (for the tab) and other pages. And the tittle which is shown in the tab.
	After that there is a body tag which encapsulates all the elements that are shown to the user. The center tag just for placing in a specific place of the page what is inside: a table tag where we can see its tags (tbody, tr and ts) that give shape to this table. And finally a script tag for a javascript source called inside de body.
2.	There are 7 files: four of them are just gifs sources (the green ones). The index page (gray) is the one we are looking at, the page where one is redirected after accessing news.ycombinator.com . There is a javascript source (yellow) and a css source (purple).
3.	The XRH allow the user to interact with the page while some elements of it are still loading. This XRH are loaded after the a reload of the page, after is first loaded.
4.	We can see that COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA. emmited that certificate and it will expirate at 21/08/2019.
